# Multi-Personality Agent (MPA)

This project that utilizes the `RoundRobinSwarm` model from [Swarms](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/) to simulate multiple personalities which tweet out dynamic content. By harnessing RoundRobinSwarm's distributed processing with multiple personalities (agents), this project allows a single agent to contain multiple personalities which have their own memories, perspectives, and style of content generated.

## ‚ú® Features

- Implements a **round-robin scheduling algorithm** for fair task distribution.
- Leverages **personalized AI agents** to mimic multiple personalities.
- Dynamic and customizable agent configurations stored in a JSON file.
- Easy extensibility for adding new personalities and adapting tasks beyond tweets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/schizoaidev/multi-personality-agent.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd multi-personality-agent
   ```
3. **Install required dependencies:**
   Use a Python virtual environment for dependency isolation:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your OpenAI/X  API keys:**
   Ensure your API Keys are set in your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
   export X_CONSUMER=""
   export X_CONSUMER_SECRET=""
   export X_ACCESS_TOKEN=""
   export X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=""
   ```

5. **Create a `personalities.json` file:**
   Add the configuration for your agents (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).

---

## üìñ Usage

Run the script to begin generating tweets from your agents:
   ```bash
   python src/__init__.py
   ```
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The project uses a `personalities.json` file to define agent configurations. An example format is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "agent_name": "Motivational Speaker",
        "system_prompt": "You're a motivational speaker. Generate uplifting and inspiring tweets for your followers.",
        "agent_description": "Focus on positivity and inspiration.",
        "max_loops": 1,
        "autosave": true,
        "dashboard": false,
        "verbose": true,
        "streaming_on": true,
        "context_length": 500
    },
    {
        "agent_name": "Tech Enthusiast",
        "system_prompt": "You're a tech expert who loves sharing cutting-edge news about AI and technology advancements.",
        "agent_description": "Provide engaging tweets about technology and AI.",
        "max_loops": 1,
        "autosave": true,
        "dashboard": false,
        "verbose": true,
        "streaming_on": true,
        "context_length": 500
    }
]
```

To configure the swarm, add or modify the JSON file to include different personality types with unique `system_prompt` fields.

## üß© How It Works

1. ### **Agent Initialization**:
   The script reads the `personalities.json` file to load agent configurations. Each agent is instantiated with unique attributes such as its name, description, context focus, and maximum loop count.

2. ### **Round-Robin Distribution**:
   A `RoundRobinSwarm` is instantiated with the list of agents, and tasks are cyclically distributed to ensure fair participation. Each agent takes a turn tweeting based on the round-robin strategy.

3. ### **Tweet Generation**:
   From the list of agents, the swarm picks one to generate a tweet based on its personality and system prompt.

4. ### **Randomization (Optional)**:
   You can randomize the selection of agents for added variety, allowing the swarm to inject spontaneity into the output.

## üí° Example Use Case

Imagine a Twitter account that mimics the voices of different characters or themes:

1. A **motivational speaker** tweets uplifting content for audience engagement.
2. A **tech enthusiast** generates tweets about AI and innovation.
3. A **sales agent** tweets persuasive content about automation tools.

By using this project, these tweets are seamlessly generated and rotated in a way that feels dynamic, natural, and engaging.

Sample Code for Tweeting:

```python
response = get_ai_response()
print("Tweeting as agent:", response)
# Here you can use a Twitter API wrapper like Tweepy to post the generated response.
```
